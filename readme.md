## Scientific Project Directory Template

This is a scientific exploration project directory following the template idea shamelessly borrowed from https://andyreagan.github.io/2017/03/21/structuring-academic-project-directories/

It is suggested that this parent folder should not be version controlled, rather the subirectories like paper, bin, figures should have their own separate version controlling.
